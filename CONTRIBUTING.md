## Contribution Strategies

Our collaboration strategy is designed to leverage GitHub's project management tools to ensure an organized, transparent, and efficient workflow. We encourage all contributions that may be benificial for a newbie to data science.

**Code Programming and Reviewing:**

* **GitHub Code Review Function:** All contributions will be submitted via pull requests and subject to review using GitHub's code review function. This allows admins to provide feedback on the changes, suggest improvements, and ensure that all code adheres to our standards before merging.

## Get Started!
1. Fork the `Beginner-data-science-projects` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```
   https://github.com/riyaeliza123/Beginner-data-science-projects.git
   ```
3. Create a branch for local development:

   ```
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.
4. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub. Only push your notebook (need not include your dataset):

   ```
   git add your-notebook.ipynb
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```
5. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
