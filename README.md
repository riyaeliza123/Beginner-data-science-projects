# Beginner-data-science-projects
Mini projects for students interested in learning data science. I created these for my students when I was mentoring at Google Crowdsource. Each notebook focuses on one key concept in DS, helping you to concentrate on one topic at a time. The original files can be found on my Kaggle.
